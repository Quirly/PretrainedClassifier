# PretrainedClassifier

In this project I finalized a Python application using a provided, pretrained image classifier. The classifier was not developed by myself, but provided. The focus here was to build an environment/application to make use of this classifier using Python.

By execution of check_images.py you will be instructed how to use the application. You can upload images and let the classifier predict the dog breed shown on the image. Besides that, you can evaluate the performance of different neural network architectures like ResNet, Alexnet and VGG.
